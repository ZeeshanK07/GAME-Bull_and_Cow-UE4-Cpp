# BullCowGame

- The demonstration film is coming soon.

Text game developed in Unreal Engine 4 and C ++ for learning purposes. There is a simple map in the game with a plate to which a component with a terminal is attached.

The player has to guess the secret word. For each wrong answer, the player loses a life. If he loses them, a recovery game may begin. A hint system has been added to the game:
- the player knows how many letters the word is
- if the player writes a good letter, he will get a cow or a bull depending on whether he wrote it in the right or wrong place (thanks to this he knows if his thinking is correct)

The final form of the game will be added as a puzzle in Mars Marine in order to hack the computers that open doors.
